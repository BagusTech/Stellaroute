								h3 Who We Are
								p We're three guys who, together, have been to over 60 countries across 6 continents and through all our travels we kept running into the same problem: the headache of planning a trip. It baffled us that travelers continually ran into the same problems when traveling and no two people had the same information for places that thousands of people had already explored. 

								p So we decided to put a stop to the madness by coming up with a solution that makes it really easy for anyone to share their insights to the places they know best. Now anyone can create a guide showing their world in their unique travel style and, hopefully, inspire the next traveler to experience something amazing. Best of all, there’s no need to set anything up or build anything - everything is point and click

								p We're brand new and still have a long way to go, but we’ve taken the first step towards building the world’s ultimate travel community - but it's a journey we're going to need your help with. If there's a feature you want to see, something you don't like, or just a cool idea we want to hear it. We're building this site for travelers like you and we need your help to do it right.
