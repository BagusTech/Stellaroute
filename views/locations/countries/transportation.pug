					h3 Overview
					p When talking about travel across the United States there is really only one option that allows travelers the ability to see attractions scattered over a great distance: the car. While planes are undoubtedly the most expedient option for traveling between cities, many of the States’ best attractions are in remote areas that are only accessible by cars. On top of that, outside the major US cities public transit can be so limited that it is virtually impossible to see a city’s attractions without the use of a car. So if you are visiting the US with the intention of seeing as much of the country as possible, have a lot of time and aren’t limiting yourself to major cities, traveling by car is your best option.

													h3.m-0.lh-1 Passport Required
														small 	p_forsberg21
													p A passport is required to enter or exit the United States. Customs will ask standard questions including what is the purpose of your visit; how long do you intend to stay; and where will you be going. If the agent senses anything suspicious in your response or appearance they will search you and your items (so for those traveling by car that means your vehicle). While the Southern border shared with Mexico tends to show more scrutiny than the Norther Canadian border, at either border agents can and will perform searchers.

														small 	j_sakic19
													p This northern border is not heavily scrutinized. With that said, busy controls can take over an hour to cross and some vehicles are randomly selected for search.

														small 	j_sakic19
													p The southern border is a source of political tension. With many people illegally crossing this border it is tightly monitored. A passport is all that is required to cross, however, there is an increased chance of being searched and qeustioned.

													h3.m-0.lh-1 Road Quality  
													p Roads in the United States are some of the best in the world though the quality certainly varies from state to state (and even city to city). In general, the roads are well maintained though states that endure harsh winters (the northern states) typically have more potholes than states with milder climates.

												span.pr-Sm.fs-48.lh-1.fc-Gr 2
												div
													h3.m-0.lh-1 Traffic Laws
													p How aggressively traffic laws are enforced can vary significantly from county to county within a state. As a general rule major cities tend to aggressively enforce traffic light, stop sign and pedestrian crosswalk violations (they are also very strict about parking violations). Many cities have speed cameras setup at lights to catch drivers running lights. The highways are patrolled by State police looking for speeding cars. While most counties show some leniency with how fast above the speed limit you can go, the general rule of thumb is anything more than 10miles is considered dangerous and 5 miles above is typically considered safe.

													h3.m-0.lh-1 Driving Style 
													p Drivers in the States tend to follow the rules of the road (both the law and unspoken rules). The left lane is the passing lane or the fast lane. Don’t drive slow in the left lane.

												span.pr-Sm.fs-48.lh-1.fc-Gr 4
												div
													h3.m-0.lh-1 Rentals 
													p There are numerous rental companies and airports will have offices with the major providers. Rental companies typically limit different destination drop-offs though some do allow it. For the providers that do allow a different destination drop-off, they will usually levy a hefty fee and limit it to airports locations.

													h3.m-0.lh-1 Tolls
													p Outside of the Northeast, tolls are not very common in the US. If you are traveling in that region and renting a car, be sure to make sure your car has an EZPass. Drivers with EZPass are automatically charged on the freeways and do not need to drive through the Cash Only lanes which can take quite a bit of time to go through.

													h3.m-0.lh-1 The Highway System
													p The highway system is an impressive and extensive network of interstate roads connecting the entire nation in a relatively straightforward grid. The ease of travel has led to the popularity of road trips and offers one of the best ways to explore the country while enjoying its scenery. Understanding the highway numbering system can assist with directions. Outside of cities the interstate roads follow a two digit numbering convention: 
														ul
															li
																strong.d-IB East to West
																p.d-IB roads that are even numbered typically indicate the highway runs from East to West with major routes ending in 0. Lower numbers tend to be in the East and higher numbers are typically found in the West. 
															li
																strong.d-IB North to South
																p.d-IB odd numbered highways are reserved for routes that run North to South with major routes ending with 1. Lower numbered highways tend to be found in the North.
															li
																strong.d-IB Three Digit Routes
																p.d-IB The highways surrounding cities, often referred to as beltways, add an additional prefix number. There can be multiple beltways that use the same parent interstate in a state so to differentiate the beltways different prefix is used. The beltway must be unique within a state but not necessarily nationally. 
															li
																strong.d-IB Exit Markers
																p.d-IB There are two different ways states label their exit signs: (1) consecutive numbering and (2) mileage. Consecutive numbering starts at either the Western or Southern most point of the state and numbers the exits consecutively starting from 1. The mileage option starts at the Western or Southern most point of the state and counts the miles from that point and labels the exit based on that distance.
